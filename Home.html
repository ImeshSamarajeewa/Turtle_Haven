        <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>Our mission as a turtle hatchery in Sri Lanka is to protect and conserve these magnificent creatures and their fragile habitats. With the alarming decline in turtle populations, we strive to make a difference by providing a safe haven for these endangered species.
            At our hatchery, we are dedicated to the rescue and rehabilitation of sea turtles, focusing on the four major species found in Sri Lankan waters: the Green Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Our primary goal is to ensure their survival and promote sustainable practices to mitigate the threats they face.
            We actively engage in the protection of nesting sites, monitoring nesting patterns, and implementing stringent measures to combat poaching and illegal trade. Our dedicated team of experts and volunteers work tirelessly to collect eggs from vulnerable nesting grounds and transfer them to our hatchery, providing a protected environment for their incubation. Once hatched, we release the baby turtles into the ocean, increasing their chances of survival.</p>
